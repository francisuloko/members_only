# Members Only (Rails Authentication)

>  In this project involves building an exclusive clubhouse where members can write anonymous posts. Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is but, outside, they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it.

This project demonstrates my understanding of Cookies, Sessions, Flashes, Controller filters and Authentication.  This was mostly achieved by installing the Devise gem which pragmatically handles all of these features. Devise comes with many useful modules which enables me to feature a sign-up/sign-in page, keep track of user sessions, encryptically store passwords using password digests and do so much more without having to build my own authentication from scratch.
